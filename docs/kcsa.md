Like the KCNA exam, the KCSA exam is considered to be the entry level exam as it pertains to Kubernetes and Cloud Native security. There are a lot of concepts here that you should be aware of but the exam is multiple choice and tests your overall understanding of fundamental things like Kubernetes security concepts, network policies, and more.

Take a look at the [Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security Associate (KCSA)](
https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-and-cloud-native-security-associate-kcsa/) page for Domain and Competency details.

Some of the topics that you should be familiar with are:

- 4Cs of Cloud Native Security
- Kubernetes cluster component security
- Kubernetes security fundamentals
- Platform security
- Compliance and security frameworks


## 4Cs of Cloud Native Security

The 4Cs of Cloud Native Security is a framework that helps you understand the different areas of security in a cloud native environment. The 4Cs are:
- Code: The code that you write and the dependencies that you use.
- Container: The container images that you build and run.
- Cluster: The Kubernetes cluster that you run your applications on.
- Cloud: The cloud provider that you run your applications on.

## Kubernetes cluster component security

Kubernetes is a complex system with many components. Each component has its own security considerations. Here are some of the key components and their security considerations:

- kube-apiserver: The API server is the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. It is responsible for serving the Kubernetes API and handling requests from clients. The API server should be secured using TLS and authentication.
- kubelet: The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node in the cluster. It is responsible for managing the state of the node and the containers running on it. It also communicates with the API server. Therefore it is important to disable anonymous authentication and use either webhook or node authorization mode to secure access to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint.
- etcd: The etcd database is used to store the state of the Kubernetes cluster. It is important to secure etcd using TLS and authentication. It is also important to restrict access to etcd to only the components that need it. You can also implement encryption at rest for etcd data.

## Kubernetes security fundamentals

Let's practice with some exercises to help familiarize yourself with the concepts.

### Managing secrets

Kubernetes Secrets are a way to store sensitive information. Secrets are stored in etcd and are base64 encoded; which is a key consideration when using them. Anyone with access to the etcd database can read the secrets. Therefore, it is important to use encryption at rest for etcd data.

You can use kubctl to create a secret from a file or literal value. For example, to create a secret from a file:

```bash
echo "mysupersecretpassword" > /tmp/mysecret
kubectl create secret generic my-secret-from-file --from-file=/tmp/mysecret
```
Or to create a secret from a literal value:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-secret-from-literals --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=mysupersecretpassword
```
You can also create a secret from an environment variable:

```bash
echo "password=mysupersecretpassword" > /tmp/myenvfile
kubectl create secret generic my-secret-from-env --from-env-file=/tmp/myenvfile
```

To view the secret, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret my-secret-from-env -o yaml
```

Notice that the secret data is base64 encoded. To decode the secret, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret my-secret-from-env -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
```

### Securing network traffic

Understanding how to secure network traffic is an important part of Kubernetes security. Without NetworkPolicies, all Pods in a cluster can communicate with each other. It is important to understand how to use NetworkPolicies to restrict network traffic, so let's practice.

Create two nginx deployments and expose them.

```bash
kubectl create namespace n287
kubectl create deploy nginx1 --image=nginx --namespace n287
kubectl create deploy nginx2 --image=nginx --namespace n287
kubectl expose deploy nginx1 --port=80 --namespace n287
kubectl expose deploy nginx2 --port=80 --namespace n287
```

By default, network traffic is wide open within a cluster. So if you exec into nginx1 Pod and try to curl to nginx2, you will get a 200 response.

```bash
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod --namespace n287 -l app=nginx1 -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME --namespace n287 -- curl -IL nginx2
```

Now let's create a NetworkPolicy that denies all ingress traffic to nginx2.

```bash
kubectl apply --namespace n287 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: n287
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx2
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```

!!! info
    The command above uses a combination of `kubectl apply` and `-f -` to create a resource from stdin. This is a common pattern used in Kubernetes tutorials and documentation to create declarative resources without creating a separate YAML file but rather using a [heredoc](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-heredoc/).

Now if you try to curl nginx2 from nginx1, you will get a 403 response.

```bash
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME --namespace n287 -- curl -IL nginx2 --connect-timeout 1
```

Now let's create a NetworkPolicy that allows ingress traffic to nginx2 from nginx1.

```bash
kubectl apply --namespace n287 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-nginx1
  namespace: n287
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx2
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx1
EOF
```

Now if you try to curl nginx2 from nginx1, you will get a 200 response.

## Platform security

Platform security is the security of the underlying infrastructure that Kubernetes runs on. This includes the operating system, the container runtime, and the cloud provider. Here are some key considerations for platform security:

- Use a minimal base image for your container images. This reduces the attack surface and makes it easier to keep your images up to date.
- Use a container runtime that supports security features like seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux. These features can help to restrict the capabilities of your containers and reduce the risk of a security breach.
- Use a runtime security tool like Falco to monitor your containers for suspicious activity. Falco can help to detect things like privilege escalation, file access, and network activity that is not allowed by your security policies.
- Use a cloud provider that has strong security features and compliance certifications. This can help to ensure that your applications are running in a secure environment.
- Implement admission control policies to enforce security policies at the time of Pod creation. This can help to ensure that only compliant Pods are allowed to run in your cluster.

## Compliance and security frameworks

Compliance and security frameworks are a set of guidelines and best practices that help organizations to secure their Kubernetes clusters. Some of the most popular frameworks include:

- [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes): A set of best practices for securing Kubernetes clusters. The benchmark includes recommendations for securing the API server, etcd, kubelet, and other components.
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework): A set of guidelines for managing cybersecurity risk. The framework includes recommendations for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.
- [PCI DSS](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS-QRG-v3_2_1.pdf): A set of security standards for organizations that handle credit card information. The standards include requirements for securing the network, applications, and data.
- [HIPAA](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html#:~:text=The%20Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and,Rule%20to%20implement%20HIPAA%20requirements.): A set of regulations for protecting the privacy and security of health information. The regulations include requirements for securing the network, applications, and data.
