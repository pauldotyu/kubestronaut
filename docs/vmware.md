## Local Virtualization with VMware

This workshop uses VMware products for local virtualization. I wrote this using macOS so VMware Fusion is used. If you are using Windows or Linux machines, you can use VMware Workstation.

With the Broadcom acquisition of VMware, the company has updated licensing for its products and both VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation Pro are now free for personal use. In this workshop, we are purely using the platform for study and learning purposes, and this workshop and study guide are free and open-source, so the free version is sufficient. If you are using VMware products for commercial purposes, you will need to purchase a license.

If you are opposed to using VMware products, you can use VirtualBox, Hyper-V or any other virtualization platform that you are comfortable with. The steps will be similar, but the screenshots will be different.
